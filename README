CS15 tictactoe README

Overview:
    The main function of my program is to carry out a digital version of tic tac toe involving two players (playerX and playerO).
    The classes are split into the main App class (given), as well as two classes that I created (TicTacToeLogic and Player). Both
    these classes implement different interfaces given by the Javadocs, CS15TicTacToePlayer and CS15TicTacToeGame. Additionally,
    the Javadocs features four other classes that I didn't create myself (also given by the Javadocs). TicTacToeLogic instantiates
    instances of classes CS15TicTacToeBoard and CS15TicTacToeController as well as PlayerX and PlayerO. Since TicTacToeLogic implements
    CS15TicTacToeGame, I defined the methods from the interface to carry out basic functions of the game (ie. restarting the game or
    claiming that no player wins). The App class contains TicTacToeLogic which contains CS15TicTacToeController, CS15TicTacToeBoard,
    and Player. Player knows about CS15TicTacToeController and CS15TicTacToeBoard.

Design Choices:
    I used association in the Player class (the class that implements CS15TicTacToePlayer) in the constructor. This is necessary
    because there are two instances of player, playerX and playerO. Each player has a different string ID (x or o), and each player
    needs to access the board and controller. I added an accessor method in Player.java called getID where I returned a String
    of the player's ID (either x or o). Player ID is a private variable, meaning I have to call the public String getID() method in
    a different class. In the TicTacToeLogic.Java class, the local variable, player, calls getID so that the
    controller can return a string with the player's ID in it.

Known bugs:
    None

Hours Spent:
    I spent a total of six hours on the project
